# Christmas Morning

Very simple platform game with trivial puzzles to solve. Help the Elf to enjoy Christmas Morning with his family. Meantime try to eat all the cookies, find all secret rooms and beat your personal time in completing the game.

Game made for Secret Santa Game Jam 2021 as a gift for @remco, it was nice to read you letter mate, I wish your best in the new year!

Happy Holidays and wonderful New Year of 2022!
