# The Christmas Eve Adventure

Santa Claus is coming to town to celebrate the end of the year. He has a list
of all the presents he needs to give out. But the Elf in charge of the gifts is
a bit confused. He needs to know how many presents are left to be distributed.

After returning to the toy factory, he finds that the Elves have left the
factory early this year to celebrate Christmas. Trying to find the other Elves,
he has stuck in a maze of twisty little passages, he finds himself lost.

Could you help the Elf in escaping the maze to celebrate the Christmas Eve with
his family? You're the last hope for the Elf. Bring the joy of the Christmas to
all the Elves!
